Welcome to aop's documentation!
===============================
**aop** is a Python package that implements the
`aop standard v1.0 <https://tolfersheim.ddns.net/index.php/s/GabziFRsMD7FLeY>`_ for
amateur astronomical observation logs.

.. note::
   This project is under active development.

Are you an amateur astronomer or astrophotographer who has some ambitions to document
their observations in a clean, meaningfull way? Maybe you are currently working on a
small, home-made research project or maybe you are just struggeling to remember the
order of all the calibration frames you took last night. Either way, the aop standard
is for you! It provides a clear and straightforward standard for the logging of amateur
observations of the night sky. aop is the Python package that implements this standard.
It only provides the means to do so, however, as it is meant to be implemented by a
front-end application. Theoretically, you could use any app that is capable of
implementing this package. We recommend the use of Am√©lie Hohe's
`Gala <https://ninatolfersheimer.github.io/gala>`_ to improve your observation logging
quality. Focus on the hobby you enjoy, and aop and Gala will do the logging for you.

On this page, you can learn everything about how to use aop. Look in the menu for
an installation guide, code examples, a tutorial walking you through every function,
and an extensive API reference that has you covered in any technical questions that might
arise. Also be sure to check out the search function and the index function if you're
searching for something specific!
