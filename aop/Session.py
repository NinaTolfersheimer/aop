class Session:
    """
    A class representing an astronomical observing session.

    The Session class provides several public methods representing different
    actions and events that occur throughout an astronomical observation.
    It is logged following the Astronomical Observation Protocol Syntax Guide.

    Attributes
    ----------
    filepath : str
        The path where the implementing script wants aop to store its files.
        This could be a part of the implementing script's installation
        directory, for example.
    state : str
        A status flag indicating the current status of the observing session.
        The class methods set this flag to either
            -> "running",

            -> "aborted" or

            -> "ended".
        Initialized in __init__() to None, updated in start() to "running".
    interrupted : bool
        A status flag indicating whether the session is currently interrupted.
        Initialized as False.
    obsID : str
        The unique observation ID generated using the __generate_observation_id()
        class method.
    name : str
        Observation title. This is not used internally, as aop relies solely on
        obsID. However, this is logged to observation parameters for
        readability and organizing.
    observer : str
        The name of the person conducting the observation.
    locationDescription : str
        A short description of the location, e.g. "12 Example Road"
    longitude : float
        The location's geographical longitude, expressed in decimal degrees.
        Eastern values are considered positive, Western values are considered
        negative.
    latitude : float
        The location's geographical latitude, expressed in decimal degrees.
        Northern values are considered positive, Southern values are considered
        negative.
    transcription : str
        The person who compiled the protocol.
    listOfGear : list
        A list of each piece of gear used for the observation. List elements
        can be of any type.
    project : str
        The title of the project this observation is a part of.
    target : str
        The object(s) that was/were observed.
    commentary : str
        General commentary referring to the whole session and not covered by
        other functionality of this module. This could provide further insight
        on the observation's purpose for example.
    digitized : bool
        Whether this is the digitization of a handwritten protocol.
    objective : str
        Why this observation was conducted, it's objective.
    digitizer : str
        The name of the person who digitized the protocol, if it has been
        digitized.
    conditionDescription : str
        A short description of the observing conditions.
    temp : float or int
        The temperature at the observing site in degrees Celsius.
    pressure : float or int
        The air pressure at the observing site in Pascal.
    humidity : float or int
        The air humidity at the observing site in percent.

        By not starting the observation when a Session object is created, it is
