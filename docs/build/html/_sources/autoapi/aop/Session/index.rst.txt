.. py:class:: Session(filepath: str, **kwargs)

   A class representing an astronomical observing session.

   The Session class provides several public methods representing different
   actions and events that occur throughout an astronomical observation.
   It is logged following the Astronomical Observation Protocol Standard v1.0.

   Attributes
   ----------
   filepath : str
       The path where the implementing script wants aop to store its files.
       This could be a part of the implementing script's installation
       directory, for example.
   state : str
       A status flag indicating the current status of the observing session.
       The class methods set this flag to either
           - "running",
           - "aborted" or
           - "ended".
       Initialized in __init__() to None, updated in start() to "running".
   interrupted : bool
       A status flag indicating whether the session is currently interrupted.
       Initialized as False.
   obsID : str
       The unique observation ID generated using the __generate_observation_id()
       class method.
   name : str
       Observation title. This is not used internally, as aop relies solely on
       obsID. However, this is logged to observation parameters for
       readability and organizing.
   observer : str
       The name of the person conducting the observation.
   locationDescription : str
       A short description of the location, e.g. "12 Example Road"
   longitude : float
       The location's geographical longitude, expressed in decimal degrees.
       Eastern values are considered positive, Western values are considered
       negative.
   latitude : float
       The location's geographical latitude, expressed in decimal degrees.
       Northern values are considered positive, Southern values are considered
       negative.
   transcription : str
       The person who compiled the protocol.
   listOfGear : list
       A list of each piece of gear used for the observation. List elements
       can be of any type.
   project : str
       The title of the project this observation is a part of.
   target : str
       The object(s) that was/were observed.
   commentary : str
       General commentary referring to the whole session and not covered by
       other functionality of this module. This could provide further insight
       on the observation's purpose for example.
   digitized : bool
       Whether this is the digitization of a handwritten protocol.
   objective : str
       Why this observation was conducted, it's objective.
   digitizer : str
       The name of the person who digitized the protocol, if it has been
       digitized.
   conditionDescription : str
       A short description of the observing conditions.
   temp : float or int
       The temperature at the observing site in degrees Celsius.
   pressure : float or int
       The air pressure at the observing site in Hectopascal.

              - ffffff is the specified fraction of a UTC second and
              - u      represents 'digits' of unique identifier characters.


   .. py:method:: start(time=-1)

      This method is called to start the observing session.

      By not starting the observation when a Session object is created, it is
      possible to prepare the Session object pre-observation as well as
      parsing existing protocols from memory into a new Session object. It
      changes the Session's "state" flag to "running" (attribute and
      parameter), as well as generating an observation ID, setting up a
      directory for the protocol and parameter log to live in, and writing
      the initial files to that directory. It also writes a Session Event
      "SEEV SESSION %obsID% STARTED" to .aop.
      Caution! This method overwrites any existing .aop protocol and .aol log
      files without warning, if there are any in the Session's directory.

      Parameters
      ----------
      time : str, optional
          An ISO 8601 conform string of the UTC datetime you want your
          observation to start. The default is -1, in which case the current
          UTC datetime will be used.

      Raises
      ------
      PermissionError
          If the user does not have the adequate access rights for reading from or writing to the .aol or .aop file.

      Returns
      -------
      None.

   .. py:method:: take_frame(n: int, ftype: str, iso: int, expt: float, ap: float, time=-1)

      This method reports the taking of one or more frame(s) of the same target and the camera settings used.

      It evaluates the type of frame provided in the 'ftype' argument to
      arrive at a string to be written to the protocol as frame type:
          - "science frame"/"science"/"sf"/"s": "science"
          - "dark frame"/"dark"/"df"/"d": "dark"
          - "flat frame"/"flat"/"ff"/"f": "flat"
          - "bias frame"/"bias"/"bf"/"b": "bias"
          - "pointing frame"/"pointing"/"pf"/"p": "pointing"
      Finally, the method writes a Frame "FRAM %n% %frame type% frame(s)
      taken with settings: Exp.t.: %expt%s, Ap.: f/%ap%, ISO: %ISO%" to the
      protocol.

      Parameters

   .. py:method:: condition_report(description=None, temp=None, pressure=None, humidity=None, time=-1)

      This method reports a condition description or measurement.

      Every argument is optional, just pass the values for the arguments you
      want to protocol. Each argument will be processed completely
      separately, so a separate protocol entry will be produced for every
      argument you provide. For each type of condition report, a
      corresponding flag will be set as an instance attribute as well as a
      parameter. This flag update will also be written to the parameter log.
      In case a description is provided, a Condition Description "CDES
      %description%" is written to the protocol, if a temperature, pressure
      or humidity is provided, however, a Condition Measurement is written to
      protocol for each:
          - "CMES Temperature: %temp%°C" and/or
          - "CMES Air Pressure: %pressure% Pa" and/or
          - "CMES Air Humidity: %humidity%%"

      Parameters
      ----------
      description : str, optional
          A short description of every relevant element influencing the
          overall observing description, but do not provide any measurements,
          as these are a Condition Measurement rather than a Condition
          Description. The default is None.
      temp : float, optional
          The measured temperature in °C. The default is None.
      pressure : float, optional
          The measured air pressure in hPa. The default is None.
      humidity : float, optional
          The measured air humidity in %. The default is None.
      time : str, optional
          An ISO 8601 conform string of the UTC datetime you want your
          condition update to be reported at. The default is -1, in which
          case the current UTC datetime will be used.

      Raises
      ------
      PermissionError
          If the user does not have the adequate access rights for reading from or writing to the .aol file.

      Returns
      -------
      None.
