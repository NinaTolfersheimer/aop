Usage
=====

Installation
------------

To use aop, you first have to install it. Since it is a Python package, you
obviously have to have Python installed. Get it from `the official website
<https://www.python.org/download/>`_ if you don't have it installed already.
You will also need the pip tool, but it usually ships with the Python
interpreter available over the link above.

After you have Python installed, we can shift our attention towards aop. Always
install it from source using pip. First download the source code from
`GitHub <https://github.com/NinaTolfersheimer/aop>`_.

After that, open a command-line or terminal and navigate to the folder you
stored the source code in, using

.. code-block:: powershell

   cd path/to/source/code

We'll provide a little example to clarify what is meant by that. Assume you've
stored the contents of the GitHub repository to
``C:\Users\Amelie\Downloads\python_source_code`` on your Windows machine. The
command-line usually starts out in your home directory. On Windows, it would
look like this:

.. code-block:: powershell

   C:\Users\Amelie>cd Downloads\python_source_code

By the way, the command-line on Windows is kind of hidden; to enter it open the
start menu and search for 'cmd.exe'.

After you've moved to the correct directory, check it's content with the
``dir``-command. You should be able to see a sub-directory named 'aop' and a file
named 'setup.py'. If not, inspect the directories above and below until you
found such a directory. The way you go to the parent directory, regardless of
your operating system, is

.. code-block:: powershell

   cd ..

On UNIX-like systems, like Linux and MacOS X, the command-line is usually
called 'Terminal' and a bit easier to find. Here, the path would be
``/home/Amelie/Downloads/python_source_code`` and the terminal would likely look
something like this:

.. code-block:: console

   amelie@amelies-computer:~$ cd Downloads/python_source_code

Now inspect it's content with the command ``ls`` and check whether you're in the
right spot as described above.

If you are sure that you are in the correct source code directory, execute the
following command:

.. code-block:: powershell

   pip install .

This should work regardless of your operating system, but if it doesn't and you
are on Linux or MacOS, try

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip3 install .

instead.

Interrupting a session
----------------------

To interrupt a running session, you can use the ``aop.Session.interrupt()``
method:

.. py:method:: aop.Session.interrupt(self, time=-1)

   This method interrupts the session.

   It sets the Session's 'interrupted' flag to True in the instance
   attribute as well as the parameter attribute. After this, it writes a
   Session Event "SEEV SESSION INTERRUPTED" to the protocol and updates
   the .aol parameter log.

   :param time: An ISO 8601 conform string of the UTC datetime you want your
            observation to be interrupted at. The default is -1, in which case
            the current UTC datetime will be used.
   :type time: str
   :raise aop.AolNotFoundError.AolNotFoundError: If the .aol file is not found.

.. py:exception:: aop.AolNotFoundError.AolNotFoundError
   Raised upon trying to interact with a non-existing .aol file.

Starting a session
------------------

.. automethod:: aop.Session.Session.start
