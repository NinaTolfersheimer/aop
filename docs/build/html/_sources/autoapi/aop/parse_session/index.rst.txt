.. py:function:: parse_session(filepath: str, session_id: str)

   This function parses a session from memory to a new Session object.

   Provided with the filepath to the general location where the protocol and
   log files are stored and an observation ID, it reads in the observation
   parameters from the session's parameter log. This information is then used
   to create a new Session object, which is returned by the function. If it
   has no observationID attribute, it is recreated from the function input.

   Parameters
   ----------
   filepath : str
       The path to the file where you expect the session directory to reside.
       This is most likely equivalent to the path passed to the Session class
       to create its files in, which in turn is most likely somewhere in the
       installation directory of the implementing script.
   session_id : str
       The observationID of the session to be parsed.

   Returns
   -------
   session : Session
       The new Session object parsed from the stored observation parameters.
       For all intents and purposes, this object is equivalent to the object
       whose parameters were used to parse, and you can use it to continue your
       observation session or protocol just the same. Just be careful not to
       run the Session.start() method again, as this would overwrite the
       existing protocol instead of continuing it!

   Raises
   ------
   AolNotFoundError
       If there is no .aol file using the specified filepath and session_id.
   SessionIDDoesntExistOnFilepathError
       If the specified session_id is not in the filepath provided.
   NotADirectoryError
       If the specified filepath does not constitute a directory.
